; -- vice-versa pairs are different from unaffected_pairs in that external factors can still affect their relations. For the above example, bandits killing loners can make Freedom angry
; -- If the pair happens to become hostile to each other, these pairs will be ignored until they make peace. Pairs that are already hostile won't come into effect unless they make peace (ex: army and loners)
