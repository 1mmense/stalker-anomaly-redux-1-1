		<text>The compact SG 552 Commando carbine was released in July 1998. It has a shorter 226 mm (8.9 in) barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a 360 mm (14.2 in) long sight radius. The return mechanism has been moved to the rear of the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed recoil spring.\n This customized version of a SIG 552 features a EOTech ATPIAL LA-5/PEQ High Power Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser and a MAGPUL AFG-2- Angled Fore Grip. \n
